# storage-access-bootstrap (unified backend)

This directory declares and provisions standard S3 access for
`knowbase-backend`.

It is disabled by default. Enable it only when this Backend owns a distinct
set of object data inside the App domain.

## Configuration

1. Review `config/access.json`.
2. Set the target Namespace, Bucket names, permissions and versioning.
3. Set `ENABLE_OBJECT_STORAGE=true` in `config/common.env`.
4. Override `SUNMOONAI_K8S_ROOT` if the `k8s` repository is not at `~/master/k8s`.

The declaration contains no credentials. The Data Platform provisioner creates
an IAM identity and writes these resources to the target Namespace:

```text
Secret:    knowbase-backend-s3
ConfigMap: knowbase-backend-s3
```

The architecture-v2 deployment generator must reference both resources with
`envFrom`. The exact Deployment wiring is established during R5; do not copy
the legacy `knowbase-admin-backend` K8s scaffold into the unified Backend.

## Commands

```bash
./storage-access-bootstrap.sh validate
./storage-access-bootstrap.sh provision
./storage-access-bootstrap.sh status
./storage-access-bootstrap.sh rotate
./storage-access-bootstrap.sh teardown
```

Convenience wrappers:

```bash
./setup-k8s-storage-access.sh
./teardown-k8s-storage-access.sh
```

`teardown` removes the IAM identity, Policy, Secret and ConfigMap. Bucket data
is retained.
